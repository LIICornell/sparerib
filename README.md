This repo contains the code for the [Docket Wrench](http://docketwrench.sunlightfoundation.com/) website and API. The API is a Django app built on the Django REST framework and MongoDB, and the site is a Backbone app that consumes that API, using D3 for data visualization.

Docket Wrench is a tool for exploring comments on US regulatory processes, with a particular focus on finding comments either submitted by corporate actors or other special interests, or orchestrated by such entities as part of organized letter-writing campaigns.
