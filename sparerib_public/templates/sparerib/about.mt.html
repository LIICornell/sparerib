            <p>Public policy doesn’t stop when Congress passes a bill and the president signs it. Laws include rules and regulations that become the responsibility of agencies within the executive branch to write. The Department of Energy, the FDA and the ATF are among the 300 federal agencies tasked with dictating these finer points of public policy.</p>

            <p>The Sunlight Foundation’s Docket Wrench helps you at this stage of policy making.</p>

            <p>Before an agency finalizes a proposed rule, there is a period of public commenting, which many special interests in Washington use to wield their influence beyond the halls of Congress. (Individuals can submit comments, too.) However, this exertion of influence in the rulemaking process has, for the most part, taken place outside the public eye.</p>

            <p>Until now.</p>

            <p>Docket Wrench makes following this influence easier by providing a suite of tools to help researchers and members of the public delve into regulatory comments. Users can search more than 3.5 million regulatory documents to see how companies, interest groups and NGOs submit public comments on proposed rules, with many also linked to their profile on Sunlight’s Influence Explorer. Docket Wrench’s visualization feature groups textually similar documents together to help find evidence of form letter campaigns by these groups.</p>

            <p>Thank you to the Hewlett Foundation who generously supported the development of Docket Wrench. Support for some of the data collection that powers this site came from the Ford Foundation. Additional thanks to the EPA eRulemaking team, which runs Regulations.gov, and was tremendously helpful in providing access to federal regulatory data.</p>

        <h3 id="data-section">Data</h3>
        <p>Docket Wrench draws its rules and comments from Regulations.gov, a U.S. government clearinghouse for federal regulatory data. Included in the data we collect are all notices, rules and proposed rules published in the Federal Register. We also collect public comments and supplemental material from the subset of agencies that use the Regulations.gov platform for public participation (approximately 175 agencies, called “participating agencies” by the Regulations.gov team). Dockets from agencies outside this subset (called “non-participating agencies”) may or may not include comments, depending on the agency and the docket.</p>

        <h3 id="methodology-section">Methodology</h3>
        <p>Docket Wrench collects documents from Regulations.gov’s API via nightly batch processes. Based on results of these API responses, source documents are then downloaded from the Regulations.gov servers and a variety of tools such as pdftotext and catdoc are used to extract text from these documents where possible. (Some submissions are scanned from paper copies and may not have undergone OCR processing, making text extraction impossible.) Both the metadata and text are searched for references to any organizations tracked in Sunlight’s <a href="http://influenceexplorer.com">Influence Explorer</a>, and exact matches to either the name of the organization or an any aliases for that organization identified by Sunlight are used to compute statistics. As <a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/blog/2011/name-standardization-name-cleaver/">we previously noted</a>, however, this process is somewhat error-prone and will continue to be, absent the use of real corporate identifiers in influence data.</p>
        <p>Docket Wrench also subjects the text of comments for which text extraction was successful to text similarity and clustering analyses to power our comment similarity visualization. The Sunlight Labs team developed this technology in house. This process is computationally intensive, and some or all of the analysis may not be visible for very large dockets; this remains an active area of development within Labs.</p>
        
        <h3 id="api-section">API</h3>
        <p>Docket Wrench's data is available in machine-readable form via its API.  For more information, see its <a href="http://sunlightlabs.github.io/sparerib/">API documentation</a>.  Note that use of the Docket Wrench API requires a <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/accounts/register/">Sunlight API key</a>.</p>
        
        <h3 id="code-section">Code</h3>
        <p>
            This project, as with most of Sunlight Labs’ work, is open source, and its source code is available to the public. Various constituent parts of Docket Wrench are housed in the following libraries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs/regulations-scraper">regulations-scraper</a>: the scraping and text extraction infrastructure of Docket Wrench</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs/sparerib">sparerib</a>: the Docket Wrench web application</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs/regs-models">regs-models</a>: data models shared by various Docket Wrench components</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs/regs-ac">regs-ac</a>: components that contribute to the Docket Wrench search interface</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs/cluster-explorer">cluster-explorer</a>: data-processing components responsible for the computation behind the comment similarity visualization</li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Additionally, we take advantage of the following third-party open source projects:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a></li>
