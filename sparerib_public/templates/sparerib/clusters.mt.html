            The display below groups together documents within this docket by their similarity to one another. Each circle in the upper portion of the display represents a group of documents that are at least 50% similar to one another.  Selecting a circle allows you to drill down and examine subsets of documents that show higher similarity percentages.  Below the main display, you can see a list of all documents within the group or subgroup you've selected, and examine the text of each document.  Each passage of text is highlighted based on how common it is within the selected group.
